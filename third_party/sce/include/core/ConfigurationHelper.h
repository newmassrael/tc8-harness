// §scxml-3.11: is this set of states a CONFIGURATION of the document, and is
// `current` its current state?
//
// A host that persisted where a machine was and is bringing it back in a new
// process hands the engine a set of states it read off a journal. Entering
// "near" the requested configuration is the one outcome that door must never
// produce, because nothing afterwards can detect it — the machine reports
// itself running, `getCurrentState` answers, and the configuration behind
// those answers is one the document never describes.
//
// So the check runs BEFORE any mutation and names what it refused. It is the
// C++ twin of the Rust runtime's `helpers::configuration::validate`, asking
// the same questions of the same static hierarchy, so a configuration one
// engine accepts is one the other accepts.
