 * - Event processing loop (§scxml-D-mainEventLoop)
 *
 * @tparam StatePolicy Policy class providing state-specific implementations.

 * Only the first is the discard §scxml-3.1.2 describes, and a

     * a configuration where nothing is enabled by NULL and the internal queue
     * is empty, and its Principles and Constraints say in as many words that
     * such a chain need not exist: *"A microstep always terminates. A

     * consist of an infinitely long sequence of microsteps. This is currently

     * One budget for the whole inner loop, not one per branch. Appendix D's
     * loop takes a microstep on an eventless transition *or* on an internal

     * that diagnostic unreachable. Measured 2026-08-20: with both at a
     * hundred, a handler that raises one event of its own per link — two
     * microsteps a link, which is what a document that logs before it fails
     * looks like — was cut at fifty links by this ceiling and
     * `errorCascadeEvents()` never moved. The factor of ten is the headroom
     * that keeps the specific report reachable for a handler raising up to
     * eight events a link; a busier one is cut here instead, which is coarser

     * @brief Enter a configuration this machine was already in, WITHOUT running

     *
     * `initialize()` is the other door and the contrast is the whole point: it
     * enters the document's initial configuration and runs the entry actions of
     * every state on the way in. This one enters a configuration the caller
     * names and runs none of them. A host that has persisted where a machine
     * was, and is bringing it back in a new process, wants the second:
     * §scxml-3.8 entry actions are "executed when the state is entered", and
     * re-executing them is a replay of what the earlier run already did — an
     * `<onentry><send>` would post its event a second time, to a peer that
     * already received it.
     *
     * ## What it takes, and why two arguments
     *
     * Exactly what the two readers on this engine publish: `getActiveStates()`
     * and `getCurrentState()`. Handing back both is not redundancy — for a
     * machine with `<parallel>` states the configuration does not determine the
     * current state. `currentState_` is the leaf the engine descended to, so
     * which region it sits in is a fact about the transition history rather
     * than about the configuration, and a set alone cannot recover it.
     *
     * ## What it refuses
     *
     * Every set that is not a configuration of THIS document — see
     * `SCE::Core::validateConfiguration` for the rules and
     * `SCE::Core::ConfigurationRejection` for what each refusal names.
     * Validation runs before any mutation, so a refused call leaves the engine
     * exactly as it was; entering "near" the requested configuration is the one
     * outcome this door must never produce, because a host has no way to detect
     * it afterwards.
     *
     * ## What it does not do
     *
     * - No `<onentry>`, and no `<onexit>`: no state is entered or left.
     * - No macrostep. `initialize()` settles the machine before returning; this
     *   does not, because the configuration handed in was already a settled
     *   one — running the loop here could take an eventless transition the
     *   earlier run had no reason to take, and fire the `<send>`s on the way.
     *   The host drives the machine on with `step()` or `tick()` as it
     *   otherwise would.
     * - No datamodel restore. §scxml-5.3 declaration still runs, so the
     *   variables exist with their document defaults and a host can then put
     *   its saved values back through `IScriptEngine` — the engine does not
     *   persist datamodel state and does not pretend to.
     *
     * The C++ twin of the Rust runtime's `Engine::enter_at`.
     *
     * @return `ConfigurationRejection::None` on success; the rule that was
     *         broken otherwise, with the engine untouched.
