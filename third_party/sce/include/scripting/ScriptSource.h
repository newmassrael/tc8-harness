 * the author's ECMAScript, which is what a diagnostic has to name. They are
 * the same string only when the engine is handed the author's own text.
 *
 * The pairing is not a formatting nicety. `LuaEngine::evaluateExpressionInternal`
 * runs its undeclared-variable check on the *lowered* text and then builds
 * `ReferenceError: <expr> is not defined` from the *original* — and that
 * message travels out on `_event.data` of `error.execution`, so an entry point
 * that received only lowered Lua would name a language the author never wrote.
 * (The clause that check keeps is cited on that function, not here: this type
 * carries the two strings, it does not implement the semantics.)
 * See docs/SCE_LUA_TRANSLATION_SEAM.md, "So the seam cannot be a one-string
 * signature".
 *
 * There is deliberately no one-argument `lua()` form. A caller with no
 * authored ECMAScript to pass must pass the Lua twice, and thereby state that
 * its diagnostics will name Lua.
