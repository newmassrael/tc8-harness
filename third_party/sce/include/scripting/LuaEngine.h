 * @brief Lua 5.4 implementation of IScriptEngine and ISessionManager
 *
 * Drop-in replacement for JSEngine using Lua instead of QuickJS.
 * Each session gets an isolated lua_State for full variable isolation.
 * ECMAScript expressions from W3C SCXML are lowered to Lua by `sce-build`'s
 * ECMAScript frontend, reached through the session's `LoweringScope`. Text the
 * frontend refuses is REFUSED here too — see `loweredTextOf`.
 *
 * Thread safety: All public methods are thread-safe via mutex protection.
 * Lua states are not shared between sessions.
