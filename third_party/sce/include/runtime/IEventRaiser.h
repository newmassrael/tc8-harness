 * @brief §scxml-3.13: how a state machine lends its macrostep budget to whoever holds the internal queue
 *
 * The clause ends a macrostep at a configuration where nothing is enabled by
 * NULL and the internal queue is empty, and the specification's Principles and
 * Constraints allow a document where that never happens — a `<raise>` answered
 * by a transition that raises again. An engine that runs it to the letter never
 * returns.
 *
 * The engine owns the budget because it also spends it on eventless
 * transitions, and one macrostep has one. The raiser owns the queue, and is
 * therefore the only party that can decline a dispatch *without consuming the
 * event*: refusing here leaves it where the next macrostep will find it, which
 * is the difference between a chain this engine declined to keep running and
 * one it silently swallowed.
