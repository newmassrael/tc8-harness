 * @brief Builds the `_ioprocessors` entry set for a session
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE.md Zero Duplication: the entry set is decided here once and
 * handed to whichever script engine backs the session, so the Interpreter and
 * the AOT engines cannot disagree about which processors a session advertises
 * or what address each advertises.
 *
 * Every processor is filed twice: under the specification's entry name and
 * under the short alias. The alias is what SCXML documents in the field index
 * with (`_ioprocessors['scxml'].location`), and the W3C conformance suite's
 * conf: vocabulary expands to the alias form as well, so an implementation that
 * published only the specification name would be unusable from the very
 * documents the entry exists to serve. Both keys carry the same location, so
 * the choice of spelling never changes where an event goes.
 *
 * Which processors appear is a property of the deployment, not of the document:
 * the SCXML Event I/O Processor is always present because the engine always
 * carries it, while the Basic HTTP processor appears only once an inbound
 * BasicHTTP endpoint has actually been declared for the session. A session with
 * no HTTP endpoint deployed advertises no HTTP entry rather than an address
 * nothing is listening on.

     * The specification requires the origin of a delivered event to match the
     * 'location' the sending session published, which is what makes it an
     * address the receiver can answer. Both engines carry the sender's BARE
     * session id internally — the interpreter in `currentOriginSessionId_`,
     * the AOT engine in `EventWithMetadata::origin` — because their
     * session-keyed lookups (`<finalize>` dispatch, cancelled-invoke
     * filtering) match on the id. Converting earlier, where the event is
     * raised, makes one value serve two consumers that need different
     * spellings, and it silently broke those lookups once already (W3C
     * 233/234). So the conversion belongs at the boundary where the value
     * becomes visible to the document, and this is that conversion.
     *
     * A remote invoke is the case that makes this more than a rename: its
     * child session is stamped with a URI rather than an id, and wrapping a
     * URI in `scxmlLocation` would produce an address naming nothing. An
     * argument that already carries a scheme is therefore passed through —
     * it is already an address.
