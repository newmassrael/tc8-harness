# SCEFindCodegen.cmake
# Single source of truth for locating the sce-codegen binary from CMake.
#
#   include(${REPO_ROOT}/cmake/SCEFindCodegen.cmake)
#   # SCE_CODEGEN now holds the resolved path
#
# Priority: 1) SCE_CODEGEN (already set by a parent CMake / installed package)
#           2) In-tree cargo build output (debug, then release)
#           3) System PATH
#
# Debug comes first because that is the only profile anything in this
# repository now builds the generator in: the binary runs identically
# either way (its cost is process start-up and I/O, not optimisation),
# while a release build compiles the whole dependency tree a second
# time instead of sharing the one clippy and the test suite already
# produced. `target/release` stays in the search path so a tree that
# still holds an older release build keeps working — but it is looked
# at second, or a stale binary would silently outrank a fresh one.
#
# Consumers include this module instead of naming a profile, because
# naming one is what broke: the profile was spelled out independently
# at ~100 sites across five languages, and moving it moved only some of
# them — the conformance jobs then looked for a release binary CI no
# longer produced. `codegen_binary_resolution.rs` fails if a profile-
# specific path reappears outside the four ecosystem locators.

# A cached path that no longer exists is worse than no path at all.
# `find_program` writes SCE_CODEGEN into CMakeCache.txt, CI restores that
# cache between runs, and `sce_codegen_drop_stale_release` deletes the
# release binary a debug-only build will not produce. The cache then names
# a file that is gone, `if(NOT SCE_CODEGEN)` is false so nothing re-resolves,
# and every generator call fails with an EMPTY error — the caller reports
# "sce-codegen list-fixtures --harness simple failed for <path>:" and stops.
# That is the C++ W3C lane's red on 2026-08-11, reproduced locally by
# configuring once and then removing the binary the cache had recorded.

# ── Generation is reproducible ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every emitted file carries a `generated-at` header, and it defaults to
# wall-clock seconds. Spec line 3505 calls it informational — it feeds
# neither the source-hash nor the template-hash — but it is still bytes in
# a compiled translation unit, so the build was not reproducible: measured
# 2026-08-13, a no-op `cmake --build build --target w3c_test_cli` produced
# a different binary (6a7d888e… → 6667bde9…) with no source changed.
#
# `sce-codegen` already implements the reproducible-builds convention
# (`now_utc_seconds` honours SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), and the committed trees
# already pin it to 0 through `regen_all_committed_trees.sh`. This is the
# same pin for build-time generation, so the two agree.
#
# What it cost while missing was not a wrong build — the field is a
# comment — but a check nobody could run: `scripts/mutate`'s second
# question is "did restoring the source restore the binaries", and against
# any ctest target that compiles generated W3C sources the answer was
# permanently no. A harness that cannot verify its own restore reports
# every case as INCONCLUSIVE, so the mutation evidence for those targets
# was unavailable rather than merely unpinned.
#
# A prefix rather than a redefinition of SCE_CODEGEN: that variable is also
# a `DEPENDS` file path and an `install(PROGRAMS)` argument, and a list
# would break both.

# ── The generator's age ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Finding the binary is not the same as finding the right one, and until
# here nothing checked the difference. CMake does not build sce-codegen:
# the generation rules list it in DEPENDS, so a *changed* binary
# regenerates, but no rule produces a new one. `target/` is also excluded
# from the transfer that populates a build machine, so a tree whose Rust
# sources are current can generate with a binary that is months old. That
# happened on 2026-08-13 — one commit compiled here and failed there, and
# the only difference between the two trees was which binary was on disk.
#
# The binary answers the question itself (`sce_build::generator_witness`
# says why the comparison must live on that side), so this asks and reports.
# The previous attempt compared mtimes from here and had to be reverted:
# the transfer is `rsync` without `-t`, so every arriving source outranked
# the remote binary and the check refused every remote configure.
#
# Only in a tree that holds the generator's sources. An installed or
# vendored SCE has nothing to compare against, and a check that cannot run
# must skip rather than fail — reporting "cannot run" as "you are stale"
# is the misattribution this repository has already paid for twice.
